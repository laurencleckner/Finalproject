# Finalproject
Our goal is to compare gut samples of healthy patients and breast cancer patients. Here, we can quantify the differences in bacteria present, potenitally identifying differencies in quantity and species.

Also, we can look at tissue samples from cancer patietns and compare that to the bacteria found in their gut microbiota. 

All of our data should be paired and amplicon. 

Here is a list of the tools that we will be using:

1. BLAST: this will be used to compare the gut microbiomes of the cancer patients and healthy patietns. This is available in the HPC.
2. Kraken2: this will be used to identify the bacteria species found in each sample. This is available in the HPC.
3. QUIIME2: this will be used to quantify the amount of bacteria present in each sample. This is available in the HPC.
