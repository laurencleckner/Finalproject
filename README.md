# Finalproject
Our goal is to compare gut samples of healthy patients and breast cancer patients. Here, we can quantify the differences in bacteria present, potenitally identifying differencies in quantity and species.

Also, we can look at tissue samples from cancer patietns and compare that to the bacteria found in their gut microbiota. 

All of our data should be paired and amplicon. 

For this project we will be using:

QUIIME2 --> to quantify the amount of bacteria present in each sample. This is available in the HPC.
