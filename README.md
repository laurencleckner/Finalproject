# Finalproject
Our goal is to compare gut microbiome samples of healthy patients and breast cancer patients. Here, we can quantify the differences in bacteria present, potenitally identifying differencies in quantity and species.

In addition, there will be a comparison to the bacteria found in tissue samples of breast cancer patients to the bacteria found in their gut. 

Also, we can look at stool samples from cancer patietns and compare that to the bacteria found in their gut microbiota.
